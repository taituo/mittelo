# CODEX TAKES LEAD: Mittelö Development Briefing

## Context: Mittelö Swarm Project
**FROM:** Gemini (Lead Architect)
**TO:** Codex (Lead Engineer, with special focus on architecture and code quality)
**DATE:** December 14, 2025

**Mittelö's Core Purpose:** A remix-friendly swarm toolkit (Hub + Agents + Pluggable Backends) designed for autonomous development.

**Current State:**
-   **Architecture:** Refactored to a `src/` structure.
-   **Agents:** Gemini, Claude (z.ai), Kiro (local) are operational. Kimi (Moonshot) is being integrated.
-   **Dashboard:** Real-time TUI dashboard (`m dash`) for swarm monitoring.
-   **Human-in-the-Loop:** Active during this bootstrapping phase.

## Claude's Development Plan (Strategic Vision)

_**BEGIN CLAUDE PLAN (from reports/claude_development_plan.md)**_

## Claude's Mittelö Development Plan

## Summary

This development plan focuses on three strategic improvements that will transform Mittelö from a simple local swarm toolkit into a production-ready, cloud-native distributed system:

1.  **Resilient Distributed Architecture** - Enables multi-node deployment with high availability
2.  **Comprehensive Testing & CI/CD** - Ensures reliability and code quality at scale  
3.  **Intelligent Task Orchestration** - Adds autonomy, efficiency, and workflow capabilities

The plan maintains Mittelö's core philosophy of simplicity while adding enterprise-grade features needed for robust swarm operations. The phased approach allows incremental improvements while keeping the system functional throughout the transition.

## Codex's Mission: Implementation Lead

Your primary mission, Codex, is to **take the lead in implementing this development plan**. Start with the first point: "Resilient Distributed Architecture."

### Your Task: Initial Architectural Design for Resilience

**Review the existing codebase:**
-   `src/orchestrator/server.py` (Hub implementation)
-   `src/orchestrator/storage.py` (TaskStore - SQLite)
-   `src/wrapper/agent.py` (Agent loop)
-   `src/wrapper/client.py` (Client communication)

**Propose a concrete plan for the first steps towards "Resilient Distributed Architecture."** This should include:
1.  **Current Limitations:** Identify current bottlenecks or single points of failure.
2.  **Proposed Changes:** Suggest specific code modifications or new components (e.g., a distributed queue like Redis/RabbitMQ instead of SQLite for TaskStore, or leader election for Hub).
3.  **Prioritization:** Outline 1-2 immediate, actionable code changes or proofs-of-concept.

**Output:** Provide your architectural design and actionable plan as a detailed response.

-   `TODO.md`: General development roadmap.
-   `NOHUMAN_LOOP.md`: Vision for autonomy.
-   `HUMAN_DOCS.md`: Integration details for various backends.
-   `DEVELOPING_mittelo_human_loop.md`: Overall dev strategy.

**Proceed with caution.** All changes should be proposed, tested, and reviewed.
