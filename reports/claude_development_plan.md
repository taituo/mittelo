# Claude's Mittelö Development Plan

## Summary

This development plan focuses on three strategic improvements that will transform Mittelö from a simple local swarm toolkit into a production-ready, cloud-native distributed system:

1.  **Resilient Distributed Architecture** - Enables multi-node deployment with high availability
2.  **Comprehensive Testing & CI/CD** - Ensures reliability and code quality at scale  
3.  **Intelligent Task Orchestration** - Adds autonomy, efficiency, and workflow capabilities

The plan maintains Mittelö's core philosophy of simplicity while adding enterprise-grade features needed for robust swarm operations. The phased approach allows incremental improvements while keeping the system functional throughout the transition.
